# Socash — Social Compute Mining on Solana

Socash transforms social activity into measurable computing power and on-chain rewards. Your Twitter account becomes a mining rig — where content becomes power and attention becomes income.

## Overview

Socash introduces a new economic primitive: **Social Compute Mining**. Instead of monetizing through centralized platforms, creators earn directly based on the measurable impact of their content.

Every tweet, interaction, and moment of growth is analyzed in real time to generate a **Power Score**. This score is written on Solana and represented through an upgradable **Power NFT** — the user’s verifiable compute identity inside the Socash ecosystem. The higher the power, the greater the rewards.

No GPUs, no mining farms, and no gatekeepers. **You are the hardware. Your influence is the compute.**

## How It Works

1. Connect Twitter to activate public data streaming  
2. Real-time analysis converts activity into computing power  
3. Power NFT updates on-chain to reflect the compute score  
4. Rewards are distributed automatically based on power

## Core Features

- **Social Compute Scoring** — converts Twitter activity into real-time computing power  
- **Power NFT Identity** — upgradable on-chain identity representing compute power  
- **Attention-to-Earn Rewards** — income proportional to social performance  
- **Viral Boost Mechanism** — power multipliers during viral spikes  
- **On-chain Transparency** — scoring and rewards are fully auditable

## Tech Architecture

- **Data Ingestion Layer** — streams standardized Twitter activity  
- **Scoring & Compute Engine** — analyzes social signals and content semantics  
- **On-chain Identity Layer** — stores compute power using upgradable Power NFTs  
- **Rewards & Economic Layer** — distributes tokens based on computing power

## FAQ

**Q: How does Socash track Twitter data?**  
A: Only publicly available metrics through Twitter’s API — never private messages or login permissions.

**Q: Do I need to post more to earn more?**  
A: Not always — quality and meaningful engagement generate higher compute power than raw volume.

**Q: Can my power decrease?**  
A: Yes — reduced activity or weaker engagement will adjust the score to maintain fairness.

**Q: Is Socash open-source?**  
A: Yes — the full codebase is publicly available and fully auditable.

## Vision

Socash empowers creators to own the value of their attention. The next era of the creator economy begins when influence becomes a real asset — measurable, verifiable, and rewarded directly on-chain.
