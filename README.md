Zoleno is a high-performance fork of Solana that integrates Zcash-grade privacy at the core, making transaction amounts, addresses and value flow fully untraceable while remaining verifiable through zero-knowledge proofs.

It also introduces a private tipping model that allows rewards and support to move freely without exposure or social pressure, enabling a more genuine form of contribution for creators, developers and communities.
```

On public blockchains, tipping has never been truly free.

Creators exposing income sources.

DAOs revealing internal structures.

Protocols exposing incentives and contributor identities.

Every reward becomes a signal — monitored, quantified, compared.

Lack of privacy turned support into pressure.

Zoleno restores tipping to its original meaning — voluntary, genuine, and unobserved — through the Shielded Pool:

▪ You can support someone, and no one will ever know who you tipped.

▪ You can be rewarded without being labeled.

▪ DAOs can distribute incentives without revealing their internal anatomy.

Privacy makes contribution authentic again.

Tipping becomes freedom — not surveillance.
